\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We propose a lossless banded reparameterization of neural network weights that enables
single-pass, uncertainty-driven progressive inference. Models compute cheaply on easy inputs
using only the first band and selectively unfold additional bands when uncertainty warrants.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Compression as baseline; dynamic compute on demand. Relation to bit-plane coding and early exits.
\section{Method}
Three-band integer-bounded split with $2^{24}$ scaling; exact merge on the fp32 lattice.
Single-pass progressive unfolding with per-sample gating.
\section{Experiments}
CPU MNIST: accuracy-latency Pareto; expansion histograms; ablations.
\section{Discussion}
Limitations, numerical considerations, portability of thresholds.
\section{Conclusion}
IMC provides a principled path to progressive precision and compute allocation.
